//A for loop contains three expressions separated by ; inside the parentheses:
//1) an initialization starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.
//2) a stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated againstâ€” if the condition evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop.
//3) an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.

for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++) {

// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
