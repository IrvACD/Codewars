//Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual items using their index, which is similar to referencing an item in a list based on the itemâ€™s position.

//Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the positions start counting from 0 rather than 1. Therefore, the first item in an array will be at position 0.

//Create a variable named listItem and set it equal to the first item in the famousSayings array using square bracket notation ([]).

//Now, console.log() the third element in the famousSayings array using bracket notation to access the element.

const famousSayings = ['Fortune favors the brave.', 'A joke is a very serious thing.', 'Where there is love there is life.'];

let listItem = famousSayings[0]

console.log(listItem)

console.log(famousSayings[2])
