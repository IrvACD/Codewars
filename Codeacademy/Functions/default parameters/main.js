//The function makeShoppingList() creates a shopping list based on the items that are passed to the function as arguments.

//Imagine that you always purchase milk, bread, and eggs every time you go shopping for groceries. To make creating a grocery list easier, letâ€™s assign default values to the parameters in makeShoppingList().

function makeShoppingList(item1 = "milk", item2 = "bread", item3 = "eggs") {
  console.log(`Remember to buy ${item1}`);
  console.log(`Remember to buy ${item2}`);
  console.log(`Remember to buy ${item3}`);
}
