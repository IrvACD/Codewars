//.filter() returns an array of elements after filtering out certain elements from the original array.
//The callback function for the .filter() method should return true or false depending on the element that is passed to it.
//The elements that cause the callback function to return true are added to the new array.
//Example:

const words = ['chair', 'music', 'pillow', 'brick', 'pen', 'door']; 
 
const shortWords = words.filter(word => {
  return word.length < 6;
});

//word.length < 6; is the condition in the callback function. Any word from the words array that has fewer than 6 characters will be added to the shortWords array.

//Call the .filter() method on randomNumbers to return values that are less than 250. Save them to a new array called smallNumbers, declared with const.

const randomNumbers = [375, 200, 3.14, 7, 13, 852];

const smallNumbers = randomNumbers.filter(numbers =>{
  return numbers < 250;
});

//Now letâ€™s work with an array of strings. Invoke .filter() on the favoriteWords array to return elements that have more than 7 characters. Save the returned array to a const variable named longFavoriteWords.

const favoriteWords = ['nostalgia', 'hyperbole', 'fervent', 'esoteric', 'serene'];

const longFavoriteWords = favoriteWords.filter(words =>{
  return words.length > 7;
});
