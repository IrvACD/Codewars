//We use curly braces, {}, to designate an object literal:

let spaceship = {}; // spaceship is an empty object

//This data is organized into key-value pairs.
//We make a key-value pair by writing the keyâ€™s name, or identifier, followed by a colon and then the value.
//We separate each key-value pair in an object literal with a comma (,).

let spaceshipA = {
  'Fuel type': 'diesel',
  color: 'silver'
};

//'spaceshipA' is an object. 'Fuel type' is a key, and 'diesel' it's value.
