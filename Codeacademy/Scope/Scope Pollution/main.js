//Scope pollution is when we have too many global variables that exist in the global namespace, or when we reuse variables across different scopes. Scope pollution makes it difficult to keep track of our different variables and sets us up for potential accidents. For example, globally scoped variables can collide with other variables that are more locally scoped, causing unexpected behavior in our code.

//You'll notice that the global variable stars was reassigned to 'Sirius'. In other words, we changed the value of the global stars variable but it's not easy to read what exactly happened. This is bad practice in code maintainability and could impact our program in ways we do not intend.

const satellite = "The Moon";
const galaxy = "The Milky Way";
let stars = "North Star";

const callMyNightSky = () => {
  stars = "Sirius";
  return "Night Sky: " + satellite + ", " + stars + ", " + galaxy;
};

console.log(callMyNightSky());
console.log(stars);
